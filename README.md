#Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Project
This repository hosts the R code and documentation files for the project of course "Getting and Cleaning data", available in coursera.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

The initial data represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

The steps to make the final data set can be found in the **run_analysis.r**. The final data set can be found in the **tidy_data.txt** file. A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work done to clean them can be found in **codeBook.md**
